When I'm not developing and building things, you can find me on Youtube learning (time to crawl out of my nerd cave and go social), keeping up with my social pages to inspire and empower victims of domestic violence, daydreaming of new ways to innovate the end of an abusive era through the use of technology, or updating mini 101 classes to ramp up the task force! </p>
